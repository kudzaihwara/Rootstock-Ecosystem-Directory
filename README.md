# Rootstock-Ecosystem-Directory
This repository is a curated, community-maintained directory of verified tokens, trusted decentralized applications (DApps), and reported scams in the Rootstock (RSK) blockchain ecosystem.

As the Rootstock network grows, so does the need for a trusted and transparent source of information. This directory helps users, developers, and contributors identify legitimate projects, avoid scams, and contribute to the overall security and reliability of the ecosystem.

## Repository Purpose

This `main` branch serves as the stable and reviewed version of the Rootstock Ecosystem Directory. It is intended to be:

- A reference point for verified Rootstock tokens and projects
- A warning system for known scams and fake contracts
- A foundation for developers building safer applications
- A public record of contributions that support ecosystem transparency
